This mini project demonstrates how to use JavaScript objects, destructuring, and array methods like `.map()` and `.forEach()` to handle and display structured data about students.

Project Description

- An array of student objects is created, each with the following properties:
  - `firstName`
  - `lastName`
  - `age`
  - `score`
  - `courses` (array of strings)

- The project uses:
  - Destructuring to extract values from each student object.
  - map() to generate formatted string descriptions for each student.
  - .forEach() to print those descriptions to the console in a clean format.

Example Output
Kelechi Otugbuali is 28 years old and scored 85. He/She is taking: Maths, English.
Muslim Ibrahim is 25 years old and scored 90. He/She is taking: Physics, Chemistry.
